# Welcome to MOGPJax!

MOGPJax is a didactic Multi-Output Gaussian process library that supports GPU
acceleration and just-in-time compilation. We seek to provide a flexible
API as close as possible to how the underlying mathematics is written on
paper to enable researchers to rapidly prototype and develop new ideas.

We are currently under major active development.

You can view the source code for MOGPJax [here on
Github](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/MOGPJax).

Check out [GPJax](https://gpjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest), for single-output Gaussian processes.

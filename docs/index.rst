Welcome to MOGPJax's documentation!
=================================

MOGPJax is a didactic multi-output Gaussian process library built on GPJax that supports GPU acceleration and just-in-time compilation. We seek to provide a flexible API as close as possible to how the underlying mathematics is written on paper to enable researchers rapidly prototype and develop new ideas.

You can view the source code for MOGPJax `here on Github <https://github.com/daniel-dodd/MOGPJax>`_.

Gaussian process 'Hello World' example
-----------------------------------------------------

For intuition of MOGPJax's exposed API, a simple example that derives the Gaussian process posterior for regression can be represented by::
